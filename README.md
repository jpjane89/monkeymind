MonkeyMind is a web application that interfaces with NeuroSky's commerically-available EEG headset, Mindwave, allowing users with the ability to conduct at-home neurofeedback training to improve focus and calm. Mimicked after other models of neurofeedback training programs, MonkeyMind uses music as a feedback mechanism: when the client's brain signals veer from the established baseline range (indicating movement, tension, or distraction), music momentarily pauses, triggering the client to re-center and focus. Unlike most other applications, MonkeyMind allows clients to choose their own music to listen to, using playlists from their personal Rdio account.
